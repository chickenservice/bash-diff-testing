# bash-diff-testing
A bash shell script that compares the output of a program to a specified _"expected-output"_ file.  

## Usage
This script was put together in a few minutes for a Computer Science course at my university so don't
expect it to be very sophisticated (yet).  

First of all create some folders (they are still hardcoded)  

* **input**:__
The input folder contains .txt files with the input you would type during runtime of your program.__

* **output:**__
The output folder should contain empty .txt files enumerated like this: output_0.txt, output_1.txt, output_2.txt and so on.

* **expected:**__
This folder contains text files with the _"expected output"_. Simply write what you program "should" output on the command line. Create and name the files exactly like the output files.

* **diffs:**__
These files should (miraculously) be autogenerated. It should work for the others too but sometimes I get an error.__

Then simply run the script from within the folder containing all those subfolders. The executable needs to be named **"d3"**.
